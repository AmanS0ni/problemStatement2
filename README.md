Problem Statement 2:-

Question:- WAP for below conditions:-
1. Print the values below N which are the multiple of x and store them in a List A.
2. Print the values below N which are multiple of y and store them in a List B.
3. Print all pairs from both List A and B whose sum is equal to T.
Example:-
Let support user given inputs
● N = 30
● X = 3
● Y = 6
● T = 15
1.) List A = [3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30]
2.) List B = [6,12,18,24,30]
3.) Here T = 15 
4.) so values will be --

3 , 12 here 3 = A[0] and 12 = B[1] and Total is 15 that is T.
9, 6 here 9 = A[2] and 6 = B[0] and Total is 15 that is T.
